## Application name: Go Mission
<br>
### Description



You're a tourist in a new location, you have a checklist of sites you want to see but you cannot decide which one to see first, well stop worrying! Let this app be your attraction planner with a twist. This app will assign you a **Mission** to see a tourist attraction based on your location. If you choose to accept and complete your task, you will be granted points based on mission type. You may accept multiple **Missions**, search other users and view score.

<br>
Good luck!
